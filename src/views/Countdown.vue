      <p><b>Description: </b>Manage your tasks and deadlines. This app allows you to add tasks with a title, description, and due date, and will count down your task until time is up. Tasks marked as completed before their due dates will be noted as "on-time" while those marked as such afterwards will be noted "overdue". The table allows for filtering and sorting your task list, and links to each task's full page.</p>
